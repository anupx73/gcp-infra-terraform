# Infrastructure provisioning for Microservices

This repo holds the terraform source code for creating:
- Kubernetes cluster on GCP to host microservices
- MongoDB Atlas cluster with GCP provider to host database

Both of these infrastructure are considered to have cloud cost impact hence the provisioning will be done only on demand basis
